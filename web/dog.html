<p><h2>Why the dog is so cute</h2>
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dog" target="_blank" title = "about dog">Domestic dogs</a>
 inherited complex behaviors, such as bite inhibition, from their wolf ancestors, which would have been pack hunters with a complex body language. <br>These sophisticated forms of social cognition and communication may account for their trainability, playfulness and ability to fit into human households and social situations. <br>These attributes have given dogs a relationship with humans that has enabled them to become one of the most successful animals today.
<br>The dogs' value to early human hunter-gatherers led to them quickly becoming ubiquitous across world cultures. <br>Dogs perform many roles for people, such as hunting, herding, pulling loads, protection, assisting police and the military, companionship and aiding disabled individuals. <br>This influence on human society has given them the nickname "man's best friend" in the Western world. In some cultures, however, dogs are also a source of meat.
